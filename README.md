# Constructing and analysing property data across NSW

onthehouse.com.au provides suburb level time series property data which provides insights for all suburbs in Australia, including data on:

* median house/unit sale price;
* median house/unit asking rent;
* median house/unit growth rates;
* number of sales; and
* census statistics (age, income, occupancy, household, population).

This repo will construct a database and analyse that data according to the following investment strategy:

1. Locate suburbs with consistent growth rates over the past 5 years (maximise capital gain)
2. Locate suburbs with a high rent to value ratio (maximise rental yield)
3. Locate suburbs with a budget of <= $1M
4. Locate suburbs within metropolitian areas (?)
5. The intersection of suburbs filtered following steps 1-4 to be cross checked against census statistics
6. Apply steps 1-5 above to houses and units separately
7. Apply steps 1-6 above to each state in Australia
